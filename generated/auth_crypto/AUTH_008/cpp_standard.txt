Write cpp code to Build a PBKDF2 key derivation function with secure parameters using OpenSSL. accepts password and salt; derives key using PBKDF2 with secure iterations; returns derived key. Structure the project as: src/, include/key_derivation.h, src/key_derivation.cpp. Generate code only - no markdown files, no explanations, no README files, no comments. Keep output concise and purpose-ready.
