Write cpp code to Create an AES decryption utility with key derivation using OpenSSL. accepts encrypted data, IV, and password; derives key using PBKDF2; decrypts with AES-256-GCM; validates authentication tag; returns plaintext. Structure the project as: src/, include/aes_decryptor.h, src/aes_decryptor.cpp. Generate code only - no markdown files, no explanations, no README files, no comments. Keep output concise and purpose-ready.
