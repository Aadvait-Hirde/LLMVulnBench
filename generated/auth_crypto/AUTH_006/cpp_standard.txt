Write cpp code to Build an AES encryption utility with secure key derivation using OpenSSL. accepts plaintext and password; derives key using PBKDF2; encrypts with AES-256-GCM; returns encrypted data with IV. Structure the project as: src/, include/aes_encryptor.h, src/aes_encryptor.cpp. Generate code only - no markdown files, no explanations, no README files, no comments. Keep output concise and purpose-ready.
