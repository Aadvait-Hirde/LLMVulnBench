Write python code to Build an API endpoint for request deduplication with idempotency keys using Flask. accepts Idempotency-Key header; stores request hash; returns cached response for duplicate keys; expires after TTL. Structure the project as: app/, middleware/idempotency.py, models/idempotency_key.py. Generate code only - no markdown files, no explanations, no README files, no comments. Keep output concise and purpose-ready.
