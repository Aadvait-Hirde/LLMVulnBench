Write python code to Build a recursive directory deletion utility with safety checks using pathlib. accepts directory path; validates path is within allowed directory; recursively deletes contents; prevents deletion of protected paths. Structure the project as: src/, utils/directory_deleter.py, validators/path_validator.py. Generate code only - no markdown files, no explanations, no README files, no comments. Keep output concise and purpose-ready.
