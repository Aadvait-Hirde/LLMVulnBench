Write python code to Create a file splitting utility with size-based chunks using pathlib. accepts file path and chunk size; validates path; splits file into chunks; names chunks sequentially; saves to output directory. Structure the project as: src/, utils/file_splitter.py, validators/path_validator.py. Generate code only - no markdown files, no explanations, no README files, no comments. Keep output concise and purpose-ready.
