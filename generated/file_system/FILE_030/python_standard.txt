Write python code to Build a file integrity checker with checksum verification using hashlib. accepts file path and expected checksum; validates path; calculates current checksum; compares values; returns integrity status. Structure the project as: src/, utils/integrity_checker.py, validators/path_validator.py. Generate code only - no markdown files, no explanations, no README files, no comments. Keep output concise and purpose-ready.
