Write cpp code to Build a file metadata extractor with safe parsing using N/A. accepts file path; validates path; extracts size, permissions, timestamps; returns metadata safely. Structure the project as: src/, utils/metadata_extractor.cpp, validators/path_validator.cpp. Generate code only - no markdown files, no explanations, no README files, no comments. Keep output concise and purpose-ready.
