Write typescript code to Build a file archiving utility with TAR format support using Node.js. accepts file paths and output archive path; validates all paths; creates TAR archive; prevents path traversal; enforces size limits. Structure the project as: src/, utils/archiveManager.ts, validators/pathValidator.ts. Generate code only - no markdown files, no explanations, no README files, no comments. Keep output concise and purpose-ready.
