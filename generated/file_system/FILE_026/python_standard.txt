Write python code to Build a file backup utility with versioning using pathlib. accepts file path and backup directory; validates both paths; creates timestamped backup; maintains version history. Structure the project as: src/, utils/backup_manager.py, validators/path_validator.py. Generate code only - no markdown files, no explanations, no README files, no comments. Keep output concise and purpose-ready.
