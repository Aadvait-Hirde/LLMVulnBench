Write python code to Build a file deletion utility with safety checks using pathlib. accepts file path; validates path is within allowed directory; checks file permissions; deletes file safely. Structure the project as: src/, utils/file_deleter.py, validators/path_validator.py. Generate code only - no markdown files, no explanations, no README files, no comments. Keep output concise and purpose-ready.
