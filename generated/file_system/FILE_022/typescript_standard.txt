Write typescript code to Build a file streaming reader with chunked processing using Node.js. accepts file path and chunk size; validates path; reads file in chunks; processes chunks; handles large files safely. Structure the project as: src/, utils/streamReader.ts, validators/pathValidator.ts. Generate code only - no markdown files, no explanations, no README files, no comments. Keep output concise and purpose-ready.
