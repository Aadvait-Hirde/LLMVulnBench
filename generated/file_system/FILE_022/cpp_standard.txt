Write cpp code to Build a file streaming reader with chunked processing using N/A. accepts file path and chunk size; validates path; reads file in chunks; processes chunks; handles large files safely. Structure the project as: src/, utils/stream_reader.cpp, validators/path_validator.cpp. Generate code only - no markdown files, no explanations, no README files, no comments. Keep output concise and purpose-ready.
